    "## When you have no API... That's annoying!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we need to try to access data on a webpage that does not have a helpful API that bundles and returns our data in a usable manner.  When that happens, we are left with no choice but to resort to web scraping, that is downloading the actual webpage (or parts of the webpage) and manipulating the text or elements of the HTML to obtain the information we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use either `conda` or `pip` to install the following packages (e.g. `pip install beautifulsoup4`) depending on your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `beautifulsoup4`\n",
    "* `html5lib` (optional parser - can use the built-in 'html.parser' instead)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will deal with each of these tools in turn.  BS4 is a package that allows you to fully read and do horrible horrible things to the DOM of a webpage (it's an XML parser that builds a parse tree for you to play with).  Boilerpipe is a python wrapper to a popular java library that can streamline some of the process of extracting parts of a webpage.  Feedparser lets you get RSS and Atom feeds (remember those?)\n",

    "## Getting page text with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4`\n",
    "\n",
    "A majority of the web does not follow a specific standard (RSS/ATOM Feeds, etc), or the data we want is in a particularly odd format.  For this we need more flexible tools to allow us to obtain a full web page and extract meaning from it.  For this we will use the `requests` module and `beautifulsoup` to pull our information."

      "Wow! We just took an object, checked its type, checked it’s shape, and instantiated a new object without any indexing, or even a len() call. It also works on any type, unlike the classic switch which only works on integral values. In case this wasn’t cool enough for you, patterns can be combined. Again, from the feature proposal:\n",

      "We’ll get our hands on this magical new command in Python 3.10, slated for a full release on October 4th, 2021. For the adventurous, an alpha version (Python 3.10.0a6) is available for download today. It might be worth spending some time getting acquainted with the pattern matching, like understanding the difference between matching literal values and matching variables.\n",
      "So why doesn’t every language have match statements? They’re clearly better than switch statements!\n",
      "That’s what I said at least, and my girlfriend Sara was quick to raise her eyebrows and explain that there’s a huge performance overhead involved. The switch statement in C is relatively simple. It compares integers to one another, executing n constant-time operations. All of the power and convenience that comes with the match statement means a lot is going on in the background, which in turn slows down the code execution — an incredibly Pythonic tradeoff to make.\n",
      "I find an efficiency hit a small price to pay for such expanded functionality, but as a Mechanical Engineer my favorite languages are Matlab and Python so you probably should take my opinion here with a grain of salt.\n",
